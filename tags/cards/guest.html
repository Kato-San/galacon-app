Including being an athlethe in school and college, pro-wrestler, bodyguard, ranch worker and motorcycle mechanic who also builds custom bikes. And he watches a cartoon show intended for little girls. Well, what do you expect from the “Manliest Brony in the World”? Dusty is known primarily for his livestreamed podcast “Stay Brony My Friends”, his YouTube videos which have gone viral, and separating convention-goers from their money at charity auctions. This has also piqued the curiosity of documentary filmmakers, thus explaining why you can see his ugly mug and manly mustache plastered all over movie theaters. And never forget to stay brony, my friends.'

He started to get noticed though with his interesting versions of popular fandom songs. Vocal has taken electronic and rap songs and given them his own special twist, a style unlike any other. When he’s not working in his own music, Vocal travels the world, playing music at five star hotels and on board cruise ships. He’s also played several brony conventions, and this will be his second time playing at GalaCon, since we loved his performance so much last year! He actually wants as many people as possible to throw song requests for him to play this year at GalaCon, so head over to his Twitter (@vocalscorepony) and request some songs!'
